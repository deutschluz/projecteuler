# Daily Programming Challenge

This repo will contain daily programming challenge problems from various 
website around the internet.

# Rules

Participants will agree to a random problem and implement a solution for it 
in an agreed upon language: java,lua,c++ should be primarily considered for this.

A bet of 25 cents is required to enter the competition.

As soon as a problem is chosen, participants have 24 hrs to provide an implementation of a 
solution.

## Special Note about Project Euler
Some problems will require processing data which does not fit in the standard 64 bit machine word length. For those problems, it might be 
necessary to add a library, usually called BigInt or something, to your coding environment. In short, you have to be able to use 
ready made libraries in your code. This can be tricky, if not impossible, in Windows.
