# Summation of primes

### Problem 10

        The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

        Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
        
        
         PSEUDOCODE ALGORITHM
         1. declare a constant variable and initialize it to two million
         2. create an algorithm to find all the primes below two million
         2a. there are already many established algorithms to perform this task
         3. once the numbers are found, sum them
         3a. a data structure might be needed to store the numbers
         4. if the sum exceeds the computer's capacity to display numbers
            display the numbers in a different equivalent form that is
            within the computer's capacity
